# Google Authentication Implementation Plan

## Research Summary (8/15 iterations used)

**Confidence**: HIGH - Found exact patterns and official Google documentation for Identity Services integration

**Key Findings**: 
- **Dependencies**: google-auth-library (installed), jsonwebtoken, @google-cloud/identity (new GIS library)
- **Architecture**: AWS Lambda backend with Express-like routing, Angular frontend with NgRx signals
- **Tech Stack**: Node.js, TypeScript, Angular 18, Material Design, AWS Lambda, DynamoDB
- **Patterns**: Follow auth pattern from `apps/backend/src/api/auth.ts`, use signal store pattern from `apps/frontend/src/store/user.store.ts`

**Critical Insights**:
- Google deprecated old Sign-In library, must use Google Identity Services (GIS)
- Current auth system has role-based access control but dummy authentication
- JWT should include organization and role info for existing auth logic integration
- Use RS256 asymmetric signing with AWS Secrets Manager for key storage

**Questions Asked** [3/3 REQUIRED]:
1. "Should I implement with the new GIS library or would you prefer a different approach?" ‚Üí "yes go with google recommendation"
2. "Should the JWT I generate include the user's organization and role information?" ‚Üí "keep org roles in the jwt"
3. "Would you prefer simple shared secret or asymmetric key signing (RS256)? What JWT expiration time?" ‚Üí "yes. 1 week"
